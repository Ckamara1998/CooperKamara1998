                Hello. My name is Cooper Kamara, I'm a responsive Web Developer and<br>
                Web Designer. I specialize in creating HTML and CSS modern and effective<br>
                websites with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. My goal is to<br> 
                create websites that look great and are easy to use. I'm always up to <br>
                date with the latest web development technologies and techniques.<br><br>
                I also design websites in WordPress. I have a lot of experience creating<br>
                responsive web designs that look great on any device. I also provide ongoing<br>
                maintenance and support for my client's websites. I am well-versed in HTML and<br>
                CSS coding and I have experience in designing and developing custom plugins <br>
                and themes. I am also familiar with SEO principles and techniques to help my <br>
                clients optimize their websites for search engine rankings.<br>
